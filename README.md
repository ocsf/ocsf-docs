## 🎯 What is OCSF?

The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) is an open-source effort to create a common schema for security events across the cybersecurity ecosystem. It addresses the challenge of inconsistent data formats by providing:

- **Standardized Schema**: Common format for security events
- **Extensibility**: Framework for domain-specific extensions  
- **Interoperability**: Enable tools to work together seamlessly
- **Community-Driven**: Backed by major industry players (see our [Contributors list](contributors.md))
