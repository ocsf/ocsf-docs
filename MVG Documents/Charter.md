# Charter for the OCSF Organization

This is the organizational charter for the Open Cybersecurity Framework (OCSF) Organization (the "Organization"). By adding their name to the Steering Committee.md file, Steering Committee members agree as follows.
## 1. Mission
The mission of the OCSF is to create an industry-wide framework for data aggregation and analysis principally for cybersecurity use cases. There are other dictionaries and schemas available from data consumer vendors, but none are fully open and few have structured taxonomies for extensibility. The OCSF is unique in its strongly typed structure, modern day data standards, and thoughtful approach to data consistency and normalization.

## 2. Steering Committee
1. Purpose. The Steering Committee will be responsible for all technical oversight, project approval and oversight, policy oversight, and trademark management for the Organization.
2. Composition. The Steering Committee voting members are listed in the steering-committee.md file in the repository. Voting member companies may be added or removed by a unanimous vote of the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will appoint a Chair responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity.

## 3. Voting
1. Decision Making. The Steering Committee will strive for all decisions to be made by consensus. While explicit agreement of the entire Steering Committee is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Steering Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee and nature of support and objections. The Steering Committee will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. If consensus cannot be reached, the Steering Committee will make the decision by a vote.
2. Voting. The Steering Committee Chair will call a vote with reasonable notice to the Steering Committee, setting out a discussion period and a separate voting period. Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. The discussion minutes related to the Organization’s public projects will subsequently be made public. In any vote, each voting representative company will have one vote. Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote require at least a 2/3 affirmative vote of all voting members.

## 4. Termination of Membership
In addition to the method set out in section 2.2, the membership of a Steering Committee member company will terminate if any of the following occur:
1. Resignation. Written notice of resignation to the Steering Committee.
2. Unreachable Member. If a member company is unresponsive at its listed handle for more than three months the Steering Committee may vote to remove the member.

## 5. Trademarks
Any names, trademarks, service marks, logos, mascots, or similar indicators of source or origin and the goodwill associated with them arising out of the Organization's activities or Organization projects' activities (the "Marks"), are controlled by the Organization. Steering Committee members may only use the Marks in accordance with the Organization's trademark policy. If a Steering Committee member is terminated or removed from the Steering Committee, any rights the Steering Committee member may have in the Marks revert to the Organization.

## 6. Antitrust Policy
The Steering Committee is bound by the Organization's antitrust policy.

## 7. No Confidentiality
Information disclosed in connection with any of the Organization's activities, including but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is presumed not confidential.

## 8. Project Criteria
In order to be eligible to be an Organization project, a project must:
* Be approved by the Steering Committee.
